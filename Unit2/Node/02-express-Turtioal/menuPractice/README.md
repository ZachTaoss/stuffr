This is to help you with my website 
## Traveling around my site 

If you just want to see the different food items names and ids 

```
"/api/menu"
```
If you want to see a item you can search it up by id 
```
"/api/menu/id"
"/api/menu/1"
```
If you want to search them up by category 

```
"/api/v1/query?search=category"
"/api/v1/query?search=lunch"
```
You can also change the menu to be displayed by highest - lowest prices or lowest - highest

```
"/api/v1/query?prices=direction"

"/api/v1/query?prices=ase"
"/api/v1/query?prices=dec"
```
